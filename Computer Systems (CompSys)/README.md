# Computer Systems (CompSys)

## Introduction
CompSys is an exciting course, but also pretty difficult. The assignments are important for gaining an understanding of the topics and of course being allowed to attend the exam, but you should not only focus on these and simply forget all the exercises, as they are what are most important in the exam.

Therefore, you should strive to actually solve all exercises (or as many as you need to truly understand the material).

In this repo you will find solutions to a lot of exercises (though they aren't guaranteed to be correct) and cheatsheets as well as links to scripts for typical CompSys problems.


## Exam (based on CompSys-2018/19)
The exam is a 4-hour written ITX exam. Prepare by reading the books, solving exercises and most importantly, solving prior exam sets where you make sure that you are able to solve the typical problems fast, so as to allow for more time for scanning the books for information for atypical problems.

#### What to bring
You should bring an USB stick with searchable forms of the book. The next most important thing, which will save you some time, is to bring one of the scripts-packages from this repo or write your own. Take a look in the `scripts`-folder.

Bringing downloaded copies of all man-pages is also highly advisable, as they may come in handy if asked what a certain function does or takes as input.

You should also look around in this repo and see what else you may find useful at the exam, and probably bring some of your own notes.
