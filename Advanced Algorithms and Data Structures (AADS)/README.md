# Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures

This is a mandatory algorithms course in the first semester of the master's in CS at DIKU. The title contains 'Advanced', but you should probably think of it as 'Algorithms and Data Structures Part 2' as the course is still an introduction, now requiring that you know a little bit about proofs and asymptotics already.

In 2018 the course subjects were

1) Max Flow
2) Linear Programming and Optimization
3) Randomized Algorithms
4) Hashing
5) van Emde Boas Trees
6) NP Completeness
7) Exact Exponential Algorithms and Parameterized Complexity
8) Approximation Algorithms

The book is CLRS + a few articles/book excerpts.
