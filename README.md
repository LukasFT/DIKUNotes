# DIKU Notes

This is a collection of information, notes and resources about courses given at the institute of computer science (DIKU) at University of Copenhagen (UCPH or KU). The intent is to:
  * Provide a more detailed description of the material covered in the courses than is given on the course database (kurser.ku.dk)
  * Guide students with a helpful overview of the courses they are taking
  * Exercise the notion of free and open information for the good of all

If you are attending courses at DIKU, please consider contributing by adding suitable information to the course folders (see guidelines below). Here, "suitable information" includes:
  * Notes on material covered during lectures
  * Solutions to exercises given during exercise classes
  * Solutions to previous exam sets
  * Reviews of elective courses, so as to help students in their choice of electives

Information *not* suitable for this repository includes:
  * Solutions to assignments (lecturers would be unhappy about this and it's probably better that you make the assignments yourself anyway)
  * Resources exclusive to the course page on Absalon (for legal reasons)
