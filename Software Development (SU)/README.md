# Softwareudvikling (SU)

## Introduction
During this course you will write a lot of code, and hopefully improve your understanding of the object-oriented paradigm.

While the assignments mainly focus on the code and writing technical reports, the course as a whole also has a clear focus on the overall design of bigger software project.

A tip from former students of this course is therefore not to fall in the trap of only coding, but not reading up on SOLID-principles, white/black-box testing, design patterns, work processes, etc. since this will be important in especially the design of your exam project, and you will be tested in the theory of this during the exam.




## Exam (based on SU-2018)
The exam is an oral exam, where you have about 10 minutes to present your final project and then there are 10 minutes where the examinators can ask you questions about your project and the curriculum in general, though they are always allowed to also ask you during the first 10 minutes.

In the folder `exam-presentations` you will find examples of how you can structure your presentation. The main things you should probably have in your presentation are:

1. Design. Describe the design and show at least one UML-diagram. Use some of the words that the lecturers love, like design patterns, coupling, the SOLID-principles, etc.
2. Show some code! This course is mainly about code, so make sure to have some in your presentation. Preferably focus on something specific that you can go into detail about rather than talking in a high level about your whole project. Make sure you understand it 100% and are able to explain it well.
3. Testing is a big part of SU, so describe how you did this and maybe also show an example of some of your tests.
4. Improvements. The main thing teachers always want to know is: How you could you have done this better? So make sure to talk about what you would improve, given you could start over with what you know now and/or had infinite time.
5. Conclusion. This should be short (max 30-60 sec), but note that the final slide shown will be this. You can therefore ''by mistake'' leave it on for the talk in the following 10 minutes, and in this way direct some of the talking points.

Make sure beforehand that your computer can be connected to the projector in the room you are assigned for exam, that you bring an USB drive with your slides just in case something breaks, and that you have your project loaded on your machine before going in so you can switch fast given a question about something.
