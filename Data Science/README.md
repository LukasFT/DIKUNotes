## Exam (based on Data Science 2019)
60% of your grade is based on a report you write on your project (predicting fake news in 2019).

The last 40% is based on a written exam, mainly focusing on database theory, but also a bit on data science.
Prepare for this by solving exercise sets and prior exam sets if you have acces to them. Make sure to bring notes in paper form as only written aids are allowed. It is advisable to also bring the cheatsheets in printed form.
