Computability and Complexity (CoCo) is a course covering the theoretical subjects of what is *computable* by various types of machines and the *complexity* (running time and space usage) of the computable things.

CoCo largely is about the theoretical structure around *languages* (sets of strings). One can define problems as a language and then consider how a machine may define such a language.

CoCo covers some things also covered in Implementering af Programmeringssprog, namely, deterministic finite automata, non-deterministic finite automata and context-free grammars. It also covers push-down automata and Turing machines.

The deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata correspond to the regular languages, which can also be described by regular expressions.

The push-down automata describes the same languages as those described by context-free grammars.

Finally the course spends a long time on Turing machines and what is computable/non-computable (decidable/undecidable) on a Turing machine. Turing machines are a theoretical machine that works slightly differently to modern day computers, but nevertheless can do all the same things.
